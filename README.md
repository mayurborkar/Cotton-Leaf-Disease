**Cotton Disease Plant** ![dd (328)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62636740/107233069-2bcd5a80-6a48-11eb-98d5-3c03b7b99964.jpg)

Agriculture is one of the important professions in many countries including India. As most part of the Indian financial system is dependent on agriculture production, the 
keen attention to the concern of food production is necessary. There is a need for a system which can automatically detect the diseases as it can bring revolution in monitoring 
large fields of crop and then plant leaves can be taken cure as soon as possible after detection of disease. The aim of the proposed system is to develop an application which recognizes cotton leaf diseases. For availing this user need to upload the image and then with the help of image processing we can get a digitized color image of a diseased 
leaf and then we can proceed with applying CNN to predict cotton leaf disease
